## Introduction  

This folder contains the implementation of the Big Data algorithm, Levenshtein distance. Given this, it refers to one of the activities of the _Concurrency Programming_ discipline taught by dr. NÃ©lio Cacho Bachelor of Information Technology at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (__UFRN__).

## About the algorithm

In resume, the Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.
